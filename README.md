# Employee Tracker

## Description

This week's challenge was to build an employee tracker using mysql tables, node js, and the inquirer package. Got a very basic app that cycles through all of the options the prompt asked for, and unfortunately did not complete the challenge. I have fallen waaay behind. However I feel like I am close to completing the challenge.To dos are to implement all the logic from my completed db files onto my server file to display all of the seeds onto a table of some kind.
